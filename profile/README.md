# Taoshi

Taoshi is leading the Bittensor revolution. We harness the full potential of Bittensor to create dynamic and rewarding subnetworks that incentivize intelligence, revolutionizing how individuals and businesses interact with the Bittensor blockchain.

## Our Products Include

### Prediction Subnet

[Subnet 8](https://github.com/taoshidev/time-series-prediction-subnet) operates on a decentralized network where each miner contributes their predictive models to forecast Bitcoin's intraday price movement up to 8 hours in the future. Miner's models are validated and tested against real-world data, then scored and rewarded in $TAO based on their grade.
